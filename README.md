**BulkyBook** is a sample application created as part of my ongoing learning journey, using Bhrugen Patel's course lecture (*link above*). 
Created a sample web application using **Asp.Net 6 MVC **, ** ASP.Net Core Identity, **EF Core**, **Repository Pattern** and **Sql Server**. 

## About Bulky 
The sample application is an e-commerce application that allows customers to purchase books online (using Stripe Payment API) and implements crud operations for managing inventory and order processing.
